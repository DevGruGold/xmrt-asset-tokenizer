## API Documentation

### REST Endpoints

The XMRT platform provides RESTful API endpoints for enterprise integration:

#### Asset Management
- `GET /api/assets` - Retrieve all assets
- `POST /api/assets` - Create new asset token
- `GET /api/assets/{id}` - Get specific asset details
- `PUT /api/assets/{id}` - Update asset information
- `DELETE /api/assets/{id}` - Burn asset token

query GetAssetDetails($assetId: ID!) {
  asset(id: $assetId) {
    id
    tokenId
    owner
    metadata {
      name
      description
      image
    }
    transferHistory {
      from
      to
